# The role of population structure in computations through neural dynamics

Code and networks for the paper Dubreuil A., Valente A., Beiran M., Mastrogiuseppe F., Ostojic S., "The role of population structure in computations through neural dynamics" *Nature Neuroscience*, 2022, [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01088-4),

## Install
To install dependencies and use the `low_rank_rnns` library, simply run in a virtual environment of your choice:
```sh
pip install -e .
```
Cuda is supported but you will need to install the `torch` package with the appropriate version for your system.

## Usage
To see how to train a low-rank RNN on a task and fit populations to its parameters, see the tutorial in `figures_notebooks/tutorial.ipynb`.


Code by Adrian Valente and Alexis Dubreuil.
